# html-debug-excercise
A short excercise debugging basic HTML code where a repo was provided with some HTML code that needed to be debugged (debug-example.html)
The solution was also provided in the repo (debug-example-fixed.html), I used it to check I'd correctly debugged the code by myself. 
My solution is in the file debug-example-i-fixed.html
